"""
one:4-space indentation, and no tabs
two:Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.
three:Use blank lines to separate
    functions and classes_6,
    and larger blocks of code inside functions.
four:When possible, put comments on a line of their own.
five:Use docstrings.
six:Use spaces around operators and after commas,
    but not directly inside bracketing constructs:
    e.g.--- a = f(1, output_formatting_1) + g(3, 4).
seven:the convention is to use UpperCamelCase for classes_6
    and lowercase_with_underscores for functions and methods.
     Always use self as the name for the first method argument
eight:Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used
    in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or
    even plain ASCII work best in any case.
nine:don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is
    only the slightest chance people speaking a different language
    will read or maintain the code.
